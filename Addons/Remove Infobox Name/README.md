**Info:**

This addon removes the subreddit name that is togheter the subscribers count/button in Infobox.

Only use it if you have the [Overlap Sidebar Image](https://www.reddit.com/r/naut/comments/8ecjy6/addon_overlap_sidebar_image/) addon and wants to remove the title because you already have the Subreddit name in the image, or if it is a need for your design.

**Note**: to use use a image that exactly fits the background, this needs to have a 
    246px
 of height. Or you can use a greater background and it will fit the card. This background size is different from used in [Overlap Sidebar Image](https://www.reddit.com/r/naut/comments/8ecjy6/addon_overlap_sidebar_image/) addon. Don't forgot to add this CSS **after** the other addon (or it will inherit the older background size)
