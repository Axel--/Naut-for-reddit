**Disclaimer:**

I'm not the author of all this code, I just saw this feature in [r/BrickBlock](https://www.reddit.com/r/BrickBlock/). Then I searched for this addon but didn't found anything about it, so I packed it as a addon by myself.


**Info:**

If you want to remove the down button (which is used to hate the posts) and use a rocket in the top button, this plugin is for you.

Upload the [rocket.png](https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/_nPIeUEGMOyoXPoFzSOmU6SVxbApw3yU7C_1RXiKxxM.png) image (that is included in this folder) to your stylesheet.

**Update history:**

If you find any error, please contact me and I'll update this.
