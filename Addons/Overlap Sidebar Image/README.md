**Info:**

This addon gives a very beautifull appearence to your sidebar image card. The Infobox (title/readers/subscribe) uses a semi-transparent color and overlaps the sidebar img.

**Note**: to use use a image that exactly fits the background, this needs to have a 
    268px
 of height. Or you can use a greater background and it will fit the card.
When using the [Infobox ReColor](https://github.com/Axel--/Naut-for-reddit/tree/master/Addons/Infobox%20ReColor) addon, don't forgot to add his CSS **after** this addon (or the background will be white) and to add the 
    80
 after the color in order to keep the transparency effect. If you think the Infobox background is so lighter to have white color in subscribers text, you can remove the

    .titlebox span.subscribers {
        color: #fff;
    }

from your [Infobox ReColor](https://github.com/Axel--/Naut-for-reddit/tree/master/Addons/Infobox%20ReColor) addon.


**Complement plugins:**

* [Remove Infobox Name](https://www.reddit.com/r/naut/comments/8ecvsr/addon_remove_infobox_name/) (if you already have the Subreddit name in the sidebar img)
