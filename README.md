Installation Instructions
===============

From here on, 'subreddit' should be changed to your subreddit name.

Step one: Setting up the sidebar
  1. Go to /r/subreddit/about/edit
  2. Paste the following in the sidebar textarea: 
    `######[Home](http://www.reddit.com#top) [hot](http://www.reddit.com/r/subreddit/hot) [new](http://www.reddit.com/r/subreddit/new/) [top](http://www.reddit.com/r/subreddit/top/)`
	`[This subreddit is night mode compatible](#/RES_SR_Config/NightModeCompatible)` (The 'This subreddit is night mode compatible' text can be ommited)
  3. Scroll down more and under 'look and feel' click 'choose file' and upload the headerbypass.png. 
  4. Hit save!

Step two: The CSS
  1. Go to /r/subreddit/about/stylesheet
  2. Paste the CSS from the stylesheet.css file into the css textarea.
  3. Upload the images from the /images/ folder - except the headerbypass one. (Don't rename them!)
  4. Hit save again!


Now you can customize it by changing the images so they're yours, just keep them the same name. There are also a bunch of customization options at the end of the css. Look into those when you want to customize something, such as the logo.

If you have any questions on how to customize, /r/csshelp might be better suited than me!
