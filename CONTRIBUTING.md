# Contributing

Community Contributions help Naut continue to be the best it can be. By Contributing to the Naut Repository you are helping the Developers, yourself, and fellow users. All Contributions are appreciated and encouraged.

## How-To

-   Fork and Clone the Naut Repository.
-   Make your desired Contributions in the `src/naut_src.css` file. Verify your Contributions are working, on your own Subreddit once complete.
-   [Compress](https://csscompressor.com/) the `src/naut_src.css`file and paste the compressed output between the Naut comments in `Naut 4 - Main CSS file.css`. Update the Last Updated comment at the top of both files.
-   Open a Pull Request in the Naut Repository. In detail and preferably with images, explain the changes you have made and why you feel your Pull Request should be merged. Eventually, the Naut Developers will review your changes and Merge your Pull Request. If any issues come up, Naut Developers will comment on your Pull Request explaining the Issue. If your Pull Request is denied, a reason will be supplied by a Naut Developer.

## Guidelines

It is requested that you maintain a specific Code Style when contributing to Naut. Take a look at the rest of Naut and attempt to mimic the Style. Naut is formatted using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), though this is not required.

We ask that you export Images as PNG using [Adobe Photoshop](http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html)'s `smallest` preset. If the Image is greater than 500kb after exporting, please use export from Photoshop without compression, then compress using [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/).
